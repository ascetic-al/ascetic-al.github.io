    <h1>The website of ascetic-al aka Arkadiusz Robak</h1>
      <p>Below are some things to do, so I don't forget, if you know what I mean!</p>
    <h2>CTF writeups</h2>
      <p>I'm beginner at that activity and I intend to change it. I'll write about Capture the Flag games I play here.</p>
    <h2>Blogs</h2>
      <p>The topics for blogs I plan on having are: broadly understood tech and broadly understood finance, though mostly focused on personal finance for beginners.</p>
    <h2>Micrologs</h2>
      <p>Here I'll write short entries about the entertainment I consume.</p>
